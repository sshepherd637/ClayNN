# MineralData

This directory acts as a store for all structural information for kaolinite and its polymorphs.

### Kaolinite

This mineral forms the majority of the data available to the NNP. I've included the `.cif` file and both the unit cell and supercell `.xyz` files within the respective sub-directories. All data I have within the NNP which is some form of kaolinite is derived from the supercell file found here. 

---

### Dickite

Contains the `.cif` file, unit cell and supercell `.xyz` files. At this point there are no dickite frames within the potential.

---

### Nacrite

Contains the `.cif` file and unit cell `.xyz` file. This directory also contains an interactive jupyter-notebook showing the construction of the supercell geometries used throughout the creation of the potentials.

---

### Halloysite

Contains both a 7A and 10A form of the original `.cif` and `.xyz` files. These frames are included here for completeness but may not ever be added to the potential based on the fact that kaolinite and halloysite only differ in their morphology at the nano scale, with halloysite being a tubular structure. The crystallographic data is extremely similar and as detailed in: 

D. Prishchenko, E. Zenkov , V. Mazurenko *et al.* *Molecular Dynamics of the Halloysite Nanotubes*, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. **2018**, pp.5841-5849, 20(8)

Halloysite can simply be treated as a larger scale version of kaolinite. 

As such, I'm not including any additional files on this mineral for the time being.
