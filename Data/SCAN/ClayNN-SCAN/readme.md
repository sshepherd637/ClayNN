The ClayNN-SCAN model contains two variants, one with mean energy of the configurations removed, and one with the absolute energy left as calculated by CP2K. This energy value subtracted from the configurations is:

-2547.2933458583398 ATOMIC UNITS

We would recommend the use of the absolute model instead of the reference model, as there is no difference in run-time computational costs and the absolute model enables comparisons of energetic values.
