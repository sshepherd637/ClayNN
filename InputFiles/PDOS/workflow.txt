This document details the steps that we took to compute the Phonon Densities of States (PDOS) using phonopy.
We used the CP2K interface as the force calculator for the phonopy package. In addition, we also provided the
neural network predicted forces to phonopy through the editing of the predicted force files to match the CP2K 
format.

This procedure is also detailed at https://phonopy.github.io/phonopy/cp2k.html#supported-cp2k-configuration-options

1. Creation of a suitable CP2K input file containing the kaolinite optimized UNIT cell. (Optimized using the necessary 
functional)
2. Creation of the displacement configurations using a 2 x 2 x 2 supercell within phonopy.
3. Computation of the atomic forces using a slightly modified procedure:
    a. Computation of the initial wavefunction by running the initial supercell structure through CP2K as an energy 
    force calculation.
    b. Recycling of the wavefunction as a starting point for all displacement configurations and computing atomic 
    forces using this.
4. Combination of the outputs into the FORCE_SETS. 
5. Creation of the PDOS using the provided pdos.conf file. We used a variety of different settings to try and compute a 
suitably sharp spectra and varied the values of SIGMA and DOS_RANGE step (3rd input parameter) to achieve this. The output 
spectra is obtained in units of Thz.
